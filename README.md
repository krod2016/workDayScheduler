Here is a screenshot of the Scheduler. 

# Technologies Used:

# Installation
* I made a folder to hold all the information together.
* Next, I added the Google API, and Bootstrap to add the 'save' image, and a font.
* I added the Moment.js to add the date and time. 

# Process
* I started off with making the HTML page.
* Using JavaScript, I made the information dynamic.
* With CSS, I was able to add some styling.
* After those pages were made, I added the floppy disk icon from JQuery
